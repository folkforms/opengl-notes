# Matrices

There are several types of matrix used:

- Camera view matrix: Represents the camera's point of view
- Light view matrix: Represents a light's point of view
- Model matrix: Represent's the model's pos/rot/scale in space
- Projection matrix: Represents the screen. It's not a view, per se. It's a way of manipulating data. For example, a perspective projection would be used in 3D games, whereas an orthographic projection would be used in 2D games.
